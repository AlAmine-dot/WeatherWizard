# ⛈️ WeatherWizard
 
 - 🔭 Weather Wizard is a pretty cool weather app. I intend to turn it into a game in few days. Users will have to pick 5 cities and try guessing their current temperature and thus. For now, it was for a small school projet so I didn't go any further, but I hope I'll get the time to pimp it soon 🙂

# 🤔 What did I learn of this project :

- Implementing clean architecture to flutter projects with GetX state manager
- Api data fetching with http and retrofit
- Basic Flutter UI layering
- Flutter UI animations
- Flutter navigation and dependency injection (bindings) with GetX
